/**
 * Clean Image URLs module: resized copies of media-library images at short,
 * cacheable URLs, and cleanImageUrl() / originalImageUrl() for themes. Off by
 * default.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *  - Media host (recommended): an R2 custom domain on the media bucket with
 *    Cloudflare Image Transformations and two URL-rewrite rules
 *    (https://media.example.com/s/<w>x<h>/<file>). Images never touch the
 *    Worker. Set with `images: { cdn }` or on the Clean Image URLs page.
 *  - Worker route: /media/<id>-<w>x<h>.<format>, read from the media bucket,
 *    resized by the Images binding, cached at the edge for a year. With a
 *    media host set, these old URLs 301 to the media host.
 *
 * Stored image sizes (with a media host): WebP and AVIF copies of each image
 * at fixed widths, made once when the image is uploaded (or, when the site
 * opts in, by the backfill for existing images), plus the site's crops, made
 * when a page first shows them; all served as plain files. responsiveImage()
 * and croppedImage() give themes their srcsets; until an image's copies exist
 * they return null and themes use cleanImageUrl() (/s/). See variants.ts.

/**
 * The backfill runs as a chain of steps, each in a Worker invocation of its own
 * (so each gets its own subrequest budget), back to back until the run is done:
 *
 *  - A trigger (turning sizes for existing images on, "Make missing sizes now",
 *    a WordPress media import, the hourly task, or a page request that sees a
 *    run with no chain) takes the run's lease (a compare-and-swap on its
 *    progress row, so there's one chain at a time) and hands the first step to
 *    the Worker itself: a POST to BACKFILL_PATH through the SELF service
 *    binding, carrying the lease's token. Like cache warming
 *    (src/pageCache/warm.ts), no work happens in the Cron Trigger itself: it
 *    runs wherever Cloudflare has room, often far from the database.
 *  - A step renews the lease, makes sizes for up to STEP_BUDGET.maxImages
 *    images (claiming no batch after STEP_BUDGET.budgetMs), then, while work
 *    is left, renews the lease again and posts the next step the same way.
 *  - The endpoint only works for the chain holding the lease: a request
 *    without its current token (a random UUID kept in the database, never sent
 *    to browsers) gets a 403 and starts nothing, so the public can't trigger
 *    transformations.
 *  - Cloudflare allows 32 Worker invocations per incoming request (each
 *    service-binding call counts), so a chain stops after MAX_HOPS steps and
 *    lets go of the lease; the next page request (or the hourly task) starts a
 *    new one. A chain that dies (an error, a deploy) leaves a lease that runs
 *    out after LEASE_MS, and the next trigger takes over the same way.
 *  - Turning sizes for existing images off stops it (keepGoing); Cloudflare
 *    Images refusing work pauses the run for PAUSE_MS (see backfillStep): page
 *    requests and the hourly task resume it after that.
 *
 * Budget per step: an image takes at most ~22 subrequests (a list, the
 * original, and for up to 5 widths a WebP and an AVIF transform and two puts)
 * plus its record, so 25 images are ≤ 575; the claims and counts (5 batches ×
 * ~5 statements), the lease (~4) and the next step's POST add ~30: ~600 of the
 * 1,000 a Worker invocation may make. Images are made 2 at a time, each
 * taking ~2–4 s, so a step ends ~15–25 s after it started, inside the 30
 * seconds waitUntil allows after its 202 response; CPU time stays small (the
 * encoding happens in the Images binding). Throughput: ~15–25 images per
 * ~20-second step, back to back, ≈ 2,000–4,000 images an hour (less with
 * large originals), against the ~15 an hour of the hourly job alone.
