/**
 * Serves Coywolf redirects (through the pack middleware in src/middleware.ts).
 * Each request reads its exact rule, if any, from D1: one row through the
 * (source, is_regex) index. Pattern rules (few) are kept in memory per
 * Worker isolate, compiled in source order, and read again after a redirect
 * edit (in this isolate at once; in others when they see the new settings
 * generation, see src/core/generation.ts), or after `cacheSeconds`. Reading
 * never writes: the table is created by the first admin write. Hits are
 * counted after the response is sent.
 *
 * With Astro's cacheCloudflare() provider, GET and HEAD redirects are kept in
 * the edge cache (Workers Cache) for 30 days, tagged REDIRECTS_TAG; any
 * redirect edit purges that tag (src/pageCache/lib.ts purgeScope). Repeats
 * served from the cache don't reach the Worker, so they aren't counted as hits.
