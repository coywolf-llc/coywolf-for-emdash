/**
 * The plugin's EmDash `admin.settingsSchema`: API keys and tokens only.
 *
 * EmDash renders this schema as the plugin's generic Settings page and uses
 * the same schema to decide which settings are encrypted: a key declared
 * `type: "secret"` is encrypted on write and decrypted on read, and reading
 * an encrypted value whose key isn't declared secret throws. So every secret
 * stays declared here permanently, whatever the feature switches or module
 * options say, and the keys never change (stored values must keep working).
 *
 * Every other setting is plain JSON, edited on its module's own admin page
 * (ctx.settings.get/set work for keys that aren't in the schema).
 *
 * Kept free of imports so tests can load it directly.
