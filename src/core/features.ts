 * Feature switches. Every Coywolf Pack feature can be turned off on the
 * Features admin page; the choices are one plugin setting ("features", an
 * object of id → boolean). Hooks and routes read it through the plugin
 * context; middleware and Astro block renderers, which run outside it, read
 * the same option row from D1 with a per-isolate cache (five minutes).
 *
 * That one query also reads every registered site setting and a few pack
 * option rows (the settings generation, the deployed version), so the
 * settings a page render needs cost no query of their own. A save through
 * the pack's admin routes clears this isolate's cache at once and records a
 * new settings generation; other isolates see it on their next read and drop
 * every cache keyed on settingsEpoch() (see src/core/generation.ts).
