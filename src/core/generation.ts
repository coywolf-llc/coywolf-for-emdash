/**
 * The settings generation: one option row the pack middleware rewrites after
 * every successful pack admin write (settings, redirects, schema, videos…).
 * Every isolate reads it in the feature switches' query (src/core/features.ts),
 * so a save made in one isolate reaches the others on their next read
 * (FEATURES_TTL_MS at most) without a query of its own, and they drop every
 * cache keyed on settingsEpoch().
 *
 * Until then another isolate may still render a page with the old settings,
 * and the page cache would keep that page for days. So a save that cleared
 * the page cache asks for a second, "settling" purge once every isolate must
 * have seen it: the first request after that time, in any isolate, claims it
 * (a compare-and-set on the row, so only one does) and purges again.
