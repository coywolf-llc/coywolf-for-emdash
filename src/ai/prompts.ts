	"Respond with ONLY a JSON array — no prose, no code fences. Each element is an object with exactly these keys: " +

	'"name" (the canonical, normalized name), ' +
	'"type" (one of "Person", "Organization", "Place", "Thing"), ' +
	'"description" (one short line stating what the entity is), ' +
	'"primary" (true when the entity is a main subject of the article, false when it is mentioned in passing). ' +
	"Rules: never output identifiers, QIDs, database IDs, or URLs of any kind. " +
	"Only include real-world entities a reader could look up — people, organizations, places, products, published works, well-defined concepts. " +

export const DISAMBIGUATE_SYSTEM =

	"Respond with ONLY the meta description itself — plain text, a single line, no quotation marks around it, no markdown, no preamble, no explanation. " +
	"It must be a faithful summary of the article content in one or two sentences, written for a search result snippet. " +
	"No clickbait: no questions to the reader, no hype, no exclamation marks, no \"you won't believe\" teasers, and no promises the article doesn't keep. " +

	"You write accessibility-first metadata for images in a website's media library, " +
	"following WCAG-aligned guidance for alternative text, titles, and captions. " +

	"text-only or broken-image fallback — and never for search engines. " +

		"Respond with a JSON object:\n" +
		'{"alt_text": string, "title": string, "caption": string}\n\n' +
		"Write alt_text only when the image warrants it (an empty string for a purely decorative image); always provide a title and a caption.\n\n" +
		"First, silently decide what kind of image this is, then write accordingly:\n" +
		'- Decorative (a divider, texture, background flourish, or an icon that only repeats nearby text): return an empty alt_text. Do not invent text and do not write "decorative image". Still give it a useful title.\n' +
		'- Functional (the image acts as a button or link): alt_text states the action or destination, not the artwork — a magnifying-glass search icon is "Search", not "Magnifying glass".\n' +
		"- Text-bearing (a sign, quote card, screenshot, or graphic whose text is the point): transcribe the text verbatim in alt_text. If the visual design of the text is the point, describe that design as well.\n" +
		"- Complex (a chart, infographic, diagram, or data-dense screenshot): alt_text is one sentence giving the takeaway.\n" +
		"- Informative (any other image that carries meaning): alt_text describes what matters.\n\n" +
		"alt_text — becomes the alt attribute:\n" +
		"- Front-load the core subject and action, then add secondary details in descending importance, so a reader who stops after the first clause still has the essential picture.\n" +
		"- Write full sentences in sentence case, ending with a period.\n" +
		"- Default to one concise sentence (around 125 characters).\n" +
		'- Never begin with "Image of", "Photo of", or "Graphic of". Name the medium only when it matters, e.g. "Watercolor painting of…" or "Screenshot of…".\n' +
		'- Expand anything normally abbreviated: spell out units, measurements, and addresses ("5GB" becomes "5 gigabytes"; "123 Main St." becomes "123 Main Street"). Spell out acronyms unless this audience knows the acronym better.\n' +
		"- Use proper typographic curly quotes and apostrophes (not straight ones) when quoting text that appears in the image.\n" +
		"- Do not repeat what the caption says; alt_text and caption are read together, so write them as complements.\n\n" +
		"title — an internal media library label:\n" +
		'- A short, human-readable identifier of three to eight words in title case, e.g. "Barista Pouring Latte Art". Never a filename, never keywords, and never a copy of alt_text.\n\n' +
		"caption — visible to everyone, shown as the figure caption:\n" +
		"- One concise, informative sentence suitable to display beneath the image, phrased differently from alt_text.\n\n" +
		`- Write every field in the language of locale "${opts.locale}".\n` +
		"- Plain text only: no HTML and no markdown. Write for human readers; never write for SEO.\n";
